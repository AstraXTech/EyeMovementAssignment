# EyeMovementAssignment
Description: A browser based program that utilizes the user's cursor to determine the direction of the eye's pupils within the user's browser window.

Moving your desktop cursor around your screen, you have the ability to change the direction of the pupils.

In the future, I hope to add the feature that the eyes will blink upon click.
